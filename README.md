## Info

The stie is build with Astro and my first project using it, the site is compleatly JS free

this site is based on [this template](https://github.com/ttomczak3/Milky-Way) mady by [Tristen Tomczakhttps](https://github.com/ttomczak3).
The website is heavily modified and doesn't resemble the template at all but it helped me understand how Astro works
